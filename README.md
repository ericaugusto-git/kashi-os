## Why
Since I saw [this website](https://www.based.gg) three years ago (2022), I got the idea to do the same thing as a portfolio. So I made this [initial version](https://ericaugusto-portfolio.netlify.app) and I wasn't really happy with it, I didn't have the skills to make things work as intended, so I dropped it to git gud at front-end dev.

Two years later, I decided to pick it up again. Along the way I found a lot of inspiration on r/unixporn and especially in the work of Dustin Brett with daedalOS (the best personal website I've ever seen‚Äîabsolute cinema). Dustin's project keeps showing me what's possible, which helps me keep pushing.

This project is a reflection of my progress since the first version, and with it, I'm still constantly improving. 

TLDR: It's just for fun like building Legos :)
